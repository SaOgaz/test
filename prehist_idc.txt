This file contains the distortion of the ACS/WFC channel 
from ACS/WFC calibration Pre SM4 programs using the observations
of 47Tuc through 10 ACS/WFC filters and their clear counterparts:
F606W F775W F475W F502N F625W F658N F555W F435W F814W F850LP.
F550M and F660N use coefficients from F555W and F658N respectively
due to lack of data in those filters.

These filters are calibrated using real data using the polynomial 
coefficients derived by comparison of the standard astrometric catalog
created for this effort (ACS-ISR-2015-6) and employing 5th order 
polynomials least squares solutions by
Kozhurina-Platias, et. al. as described in ACS-ISR 2015-6.
This file can be used as described in ACS-ISR 2015-2.

Polarizer coefficients use the full frame coefficients from the
accompanying color filter crossed with CLEAR as that gives the closest
results to the actual distortion.

Ramp filter coefficients contain the old, 4th order, coefficients
with the 5th order coefficients zero'd out. Due to lack of data
we are unable to fully calibrate these filters to the same precision
as other filters.

The coefficients of all other non-calibrated filters are the same
coefficients as F606W and clear as it has the best calibration.
Calibrations for these filters will be made if more data is made
available.

This file contains an entry for every possible combination of filters
in the WFC filter wheel even if they are not a valid combination for
WFC.

The reference point in the ACS/WFC V2V3 coordinate 
system is calibrated following the alignment measurements 
of ACS/WFC channel in Jan 2002.  

All coefficients in this file have been corrected for vafactor issues.
