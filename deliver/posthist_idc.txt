This file contains the distortion of the ACS/WFC channel 
from ACS/WFC calibration Post SM4 programs using the observations
of 47Tuc through 10 ACS/WFC filters and their clear counterparts:
F606W F775W F475W F502N F625W F658N F555W F435W F814W F850LP

These filters are calibrated using real data using the polynomial 
coefficients derived by comparison of the standard astrometric catalog
created for this effort (ACS-ISR-2015-6) and employing 5th order 
polynomials least squares solutions by
Kozhurina-Platias, et. al. as described in ACS-ISR 2015-6. 
This file can be used as described in ACS-ISR 2015-2.

The coefficients of non-calibrated filters are the same coefficients
as F606W and clear as it has the best calibration. 
Calibrations for the other filters will be made as data is processed.
This file contains an entry for every possible combination of filters
in the WFC filter wheel even if they are not a valid combination for
WFC. Ramp filters and Polarizers are NOT properly calibrated with this
file and should use the old distortion solution reference files.

The reference point in the ACS/WFC V2V3 coordinate 
system is calibrated following the alignment measurements 
of ACS/WFC channel in Jun 27 2011.  

all coefficients in this file have been corrected for vafactor issues.

This file was previously named: 020216_post_fsw_idc7.fits.

Updated for correct subarray size for polarizer filters
after Flight Software Update to change subarray readout.
